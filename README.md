# pix2pix from scratch

An attempt at creating a pix2pix implementation from scratch, using only Tensorflow as a dependency.

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/pix2pix

## Setup

I'm using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to set up my Python 3 environment.

Initialize a new environment with Tensorflow as a dependency:

```
conda create -n pix2pix tensorflow jupyterlab
```

Activate the new environment:

```
conda activate pix2pix

```

Start Jupyter Lab:

```
jupyter lab
```
